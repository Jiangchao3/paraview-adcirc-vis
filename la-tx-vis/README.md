# Visualize ADCIRC results with a view of the Louisiana-Texas Coast
- zoomToLaTxEl.py - This script zooms to a view of the Texas and Louisiana coasts, and sets color map properties for bathymetry and water elevation. It is assumed than a file with water elevation data is being loaded to ParaView (the file can have other kinds of data as well, but water elevation is a minimum requirement for this script).
